				<h2> PYTHON BASICS </h2>
				<h3> Conditionals (If/Else Statements) </h3>
				<p>The third essential component of Python we are going to cover are what computer scientists call conditionals. These are statements that describe the condition of a variable.</p>
				<p> In most programming languages, including Python, conditionals are denoted with the statements <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>. The conditional in Python is written as "if (variable) =/>/< x:". Like in loops, the colon denotes an indented block of code that runs when the condition is met. If the condition is not met (<code>else:</code>), then another indented block of code runs.</p> 
				<p> There is also a midpoint between <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> called <code>elif</code>, which denotes an alternate block of code that runs when one condition is not met but another is (in this case the <code>else</code> runs if none of the conditions are met). Unlike <code>if</code> and <code>else</code>, you can have as many of these as you like between the opening <code>if</code> and closing <code>else</code>. In other programming languages, this statement is called <code>else if</code> or some other variation, but in Python the words are combined and it is written as <code>elif</code>.</p>

				<h3> Example Code </h3>
				<p> Copy this code to your IDE, save it and run it in the module to see what happens:</p>
				<section>
					<code>
						<pre>
age = <span class="purple">int</span>(<span class="purple">input</span>(<span class="green">"Welcome to the Club! How old are you?"</span>))

<span class="orange">if</span> age >= 18:
	<span class="purple">print</span>(<span class="green">"Come on in!"</span>)

<span class="orange">else</span>:
	<span class="purple">print</span>(<span class="green">"Sorry, you're too young"</span>)
						</pre>
